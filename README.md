Here in this project I have analyised the data of csv file of Zomato through the certain libraries. And from that I have cover following points:
What type of resturant do majority of customers order from?
How  many votes has each type of restaurant received from customers?
What are the ratings that majority of resturants have received ?
Average order spending by couples.
Which mode has received the maximum rating?
Which type of resturant received more offline orders?
